Basilisk is useful today, especially if your collections are not especially large. If you are
performing updates on large items (> 200 items) you may not find the performance to be acceptable
to you.

General
-------

* Benchmarks: hard to know what it *is* good for without some numbers.
*

Datastructures
--------------

* Pull in or write an implementation of a PersistentBitmapTrie for Vectors and HashMaps
* A Set would probably be useful.

Query
-----

* Paths should probably be chainable in some way.  Try out a few APIs to see which work.
