The core of Basilisk is:

 * A ``Struct`` interface: a way to define immutable objects with a consistent 
   way to make new versions of them.
 * A selection of high-quality persistent (immutable) data structures: Maps and Vectors.
 * The Query model: an easy-to-read, simple-to-reason-about way to create 
   new versions of more complex objects.
