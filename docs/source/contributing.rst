Contributing
============

Contributions are *extremely* welcome.  We ask that you please include tests
and documentation as you go, since it is a lot easier than doing it after the 
fact.

We are aiming to have only the absolute essentials included in the main basilisk
library: this is to make sure that we don't have to provide too much backward 
compatibility for experimental ideas.  We will happily include things which have
stood the test of time, though.

Development work happens `on github <https://github.com/basiliskjs/basilisk>`_.
